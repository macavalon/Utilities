wifiWatcher
=============

A simple windows c# program to toggle your wifi off/on, when it can't ping google

I've found in the past that sometimes wifi connections become stale, or aren't connected properly to their routers.
And the symptom can be resolved by toggling the connection

The program "bin/Debug/wifiWatcher.exe" needs to be run with admin rights (e.g. from windows explorer right click "Run As Administrator")
otherwise it doesn't have permission to toggle the connection
